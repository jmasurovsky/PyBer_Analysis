# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

As a data analyst for PyBer, a ride sharing app company, an exlporatory analysis was performed on the app's data to visualize the relationships between the city's number of drivers, number of riders, its total fares by city and type of area (urban, suburban, or rural). The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type and to visualize the total weekly fares for each city type as a multiple-line graph.
